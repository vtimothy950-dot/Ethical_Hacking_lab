| **Operation Aurora (2010)**       | **Illegal** | A sophisticated cyber-attack originating from China targeted major U.S. companies, including Google, to steal intellectual property and access email accounts of activists. The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The incident led to heightened awareness of cybersecurity and the adoption of stronger defense measures across industries. |
| **WannaCry Ransomware (2017)**    | **Illegal** | The WannaCry attack spread rapidly across 150+ countries, encrypting data on hundreds of thousands of computers and demanding ransom payments in Bitcoin. It exploited a Windows vulnerability leaked from NSA tools. The attack disrupted hospitals, businesses, and governments, emphasizing the global risks of unpatched systems.                                |
| **FBI Honeypot Operation (2021)** | **Legal**   | The FBI legally ran a global sting operation using the ANOM encrypted messaging app to monitor criminal communications. This controlled cyber operation led to hundreds of arrests worldwide and seizures of illegal goods. It demonstrated how lawful cyber tactics can combat organized cybercrime effectively.                                                    |
Short Report: Ethical and Legal Implications

Cyber operations raise complex ethical and legal concerns. Illegal attacks like Operation Aurora and WannaCry violated privacy, caused financial loss, and endangered critical infrastructureâ€”breaching international law and ethical standards of data protection and digital responsibility. In contrast, legal cyber operations such as the FBI Honeypot demonstrate how government agencies can ethically employ cyber tactics to uphold justice while respecting due process and human rights. Overall, the distinction between ethical and unethical cyber behavior depends on intent, legality, and adherence to established digital ethics frameworks.
